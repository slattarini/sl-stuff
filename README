Personal files, configurations and utilities of Stefano Lattarini.

A collection of utilities, scripts and initialization files that I
use on my machines, both local and remote-access only, running varying
operating systems (at least GNU/Linux, BSD and Solaris, so far).

I find it better to keep all of this centralized and under version
control, to avoid synchronization and backup issues (and lots of
headaches).

See the README files in the subdirs for further details about components
and sub-projects of this repository.

This project is not actually meant nor expected to be used by any
other person; but if someone reading this can find interesting bits
and pieces and want to steal some — be my guest :–)
